Many web-based teaching tool applets programmed in Java/Javascript are publicly available (e.g., www.rossmanchance.com, www.socr.ucla.edu). These provide a user-friendly interface which is accessible and appealing to students in introductory statistics courses. However, not all statistics educators are fluent in Java/Javascript and may not be able to tailor these apps or develop their own. Shiny, a web application framework for R created by RStudio, facilitates applet development for educators who are familiar with R. We illustrate the utility, convenience, and versatility of Shiny through our collection of 17 freely available apps covering a range of topics and levels (found at www.statistics.calpoly.edu/shiny). Our Shiny source code is publicly available so that anyone may tailor our apps as desired. We provide feedback on how our apps have been used in statistics classes including some challenges that were encountered. We also discuss feasibility on building, launching, and deploying Shiny apps. A brief tutorial on installing and using Shiny is provided in the appendix. Some teaching materials based on our Shiny apps are also included in the appendix.},

The tutorial assignment includes diagnostic multiple-choice questions with feedback addressing misconceptions, and follow-up questions suitable for grading. The sampling exercises utilize an interactive Java applet that graphically demonstrates relationships between statistical power and effect size, null and alternative populations and sampling distributions, and Type I and II error rates. The applet allows students to manipulate the mean and standard deviation of populations, sample sizes, and Type I error rate. Students (n = 84) enrolled in introductory and intermediate statistics courses overwhelmingly rated the tutorial as clear, useful, easy to use, and they reported increased comfort with the topic of statistical power after using the tutorial. Students who used the tutorial outperformed those who did not use the tutorial on a final exam question measuring knowledge of the factors influencing statistical power.},

We make use of the Shiny web-based application framework for R to develop “Shiny apps” designed to help facilitate student interaction with methods from recently published papers in the author’s primary research ﬁeld (extreme value theory and applications). We also replace some lectures with dedicated “reading group tutorials.” Here, students work in small groups to discuss and critique carefully selected papers from the ﬁeld. They are also encouraged to use our Shiny apps to implement some of the methods discussed in the papers with their own data, for use in project work. We attempt to evaluate our innovation by comparing students’ responses in open-ended data analysis work, and work requiring the interpretation of methods in a recently published paper, to those of students who took the same course two years earlier when our Shiny apps were not available and when research tutorials were not used. This comparison, along with results from a student questionnaire, gives us some conﬁdence that our methods have beneﬁted students, not only in terms of their ability to understand and implement advanced techniques from the recent literature but also in terms of their conﬁdence and overall satisfaction with the course.},
